How to run?
1. software: (use lena.bmp as input image)
   1.1 change directory to gaussian_sw, type "cd gaussian_sw"
   1.2 type "make".
   1.3 type "./gaussian".
   1.4 you will get output image "lena_gaussian_sw.bmp".
2. SystemC: (use lena_std_short.bmp as input image)
   2.1 change directory to gaussian_sw, type "cd gaussian_sc"
   2.2 build new directory, type "mkdir build".
   2.3 change directory to build, type "cd build"
   2.3 type "cmake ..".
   2.3 type "make run".
   2.4 you will get output image "out.bmp".
